  XML Tools: Your Go-To Spot for Free XML Goodies
Hey there! Welcome to XML Tools, a super handy website I whipped up to make working with XML a breeze. If you're a developer tired of fiddling with clunky XML files, this is your new best friend. No sign-ups, no fees—just jump in and get stuff done. Built entirely with good ol' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's lightweight and runs right in your browser.
What’s It All About?
Picture this: You've got XML data that's a hot mess, or you need to convert it to JSON super quick. That's where XML Tools comes in. I've packed in over 23 free utilities that handle everything from formatting and validating to converting and transforming XML. It's all online at xmltools.github.io, hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.
Cool Features
Here's a rundown of what you can do:

Format and Beautify: Turn ugly XML into something readable with proper indentation.
Validate: Check if your XML is legit and error-free.
Convert Between Formats: Swap XML to JSON, CSV, YAML, HTML, and back again.
Advanced Stuff: Test XPath expressions, apply XSLT transformations, compare XML files, escape/unescape characters, and more.
Editing and Viewing: Use the XML editor with syntax highlighting or view it in a tree structure.
Extra Utilities: Generate sample XML, sort elements, merge or split files—the list goes on!

All tools are instant and user-friendly, with simple interfaces to paste your data and hit go.
Built With

HTML: For the structure and bones.
CSS: To make it look nice and responsive.
JavaScript: Powers all the magic behind the tools.

Thanks for stopping by—happy XML-ing! 🚀

Hey folks, let's dive deeper into XML Tools. This isn't just another random site; it's a passion project born out of my own frustrations with XML handling during dev work. I built it from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS—no fancy frameworks, keeping it simple and fast-loading. The goal? Provide developers with a one-stop shop for all things XML, without the hassle of downloads or installations.
The Backstory
I started this back when I was knee-deep in projects involving tons of XML data. Tools were either paid, bloated, or required sign-ups. So, I thought, why not create something free and accessible? Hosted on GitHub Pages at xmltools.github.io, it's open for anyone to use and contribute to. As of now, it's got over 23 utilities, and I'm always thinking about adding more based on feedback.
Full Tool Breakdown
To give you a comprehensive look, here's every tool available, grouped by category for easier navigation. Each one is designed to be intuitive: paste your input, tweak options if needed, and get results instantly.
Formatting and Beautification Tools

XML Formatter: Adds indentation, line breaks, and structure to make XML pretty.
XML Minifier: Strips out all unnecessary whitespace for compact files.
XML Beautifier: Similar to formatter but with extra readability tweaks.

Validation and Testing

XML Validator: Scans for syntax errors and ensures well-formed structure.
XML Schema Validator: Checks against an XSD schema for compliance.
XPath Tester: Lets you run and debug XPath queries on your XML.

Conversion Utilities
These are super popular for integrating XML with other data formats:

XML to JSON: Transforms XML into JSON objects.
JSON to XML: Goes the other way, converting JSON back to XML.
XML to CSV: Exports XML data into comma-separated values.
CSV to XML: Imports CSV and structures it as XML.
XML to YAML: Converts to YAML for config files or APIs.
YAML to XML: Reverses that process.
XML to HTML: Renders XML as an HTML table for easy viewing.

Transformation and Manipulation

XSLT Transformer: Applies XSLT stylesheets to reshape XML.
XML Diff: Highlights differences between two XML documents.
XML Escape/Unescape: Handles special characters for safe embedding.
XML Sorter: Alphabetically orders elements.
XML Merger: Combines multiple XML files into one.
XML Splitter: Breaks down large XML into manageable chunks.

Viewing and Editing

XML Viewer: Displays XML in a collapsible tree view.
XML Editor: Full-featured editor with syntax highlighting and auto-complete hints.
XML Parser: Breaks down and extracts specific parts of XML.
XML Generator: Creates dummy XML for testing purposes.

This table summarizes the toolkit—notice how conversions dominate because that's what devs need most for interoperability.
Technical Details
Everything runs client-side thanks to JavaScript. For instance, the XML Parser uses DOMParser for native browser support, while conversions leverage custom recursive functions to handle nested structures. CSS ensures a clean, modern look with responsive design for mobile users. No server-side processing means your data stays private.
Usage Tips
Getting started is easy:

Head to xmltools.github.io.
Pick a tool from the list.
Paste your XML (or other input) into the box.
Hit the button and copy the output.

Pro tip: For large files, some tools might have browser limits, but most handle up to a few MB fine.
